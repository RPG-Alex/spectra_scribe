//! # SpectraScribe
//!
//! `spectra_scribe` trains and evaluates machine-learning models for MS/MS
//! element identification.
//!
//! The crate currently provides an experimental pipeline for:
//!
//! - loading annotated MS/MS spectra,
//! - converting spectra into binned intensity vectors,
//! - training multi-label element classifiers,
//! - evaluating predictions across multiple thresholds,
//! - writing per-holdout and whole-experiment CSV reports.
//!
//! This is research software. APIs, model architecture, output formats, and
//! experiment protocols are expected to change while the task definition is
//! being refined.
